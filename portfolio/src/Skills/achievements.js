            <h3>Leadership</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout my educational journey, {"I've"} actively taken on leadership roles. In
                high school, I served on leadership committees, and my portfolio included sports
                management. This leadership spirit continued during my time at De Wilgers {"Men's"}
                Residence, where I held a position on the House Committee from 2020 to 2021. In this
                role, I managed various responsibilities, including overseeing hostel media,
                maintaining records of activities, and handling recruitment duties, such as school
                visits, sporting events, and our {"university's"} open day.

            <h3>Academic</h3>
            <p>
                My commitment to excellence in academics led to my membership in the Golden Key
                Honor Society in 2021â€”a testament to my dedication and hard work. Additionally, I
                proudly earned my BSc IT degree in 2022 and am currently on the verge of completing
                my BSc Honors in Computer Science and Information Systems in 2023.

            <h3>Certificates</h3>
            <p>
                I have a passion for continuous learning, utilizing not only university resources
                but also external platforms to expand my knowledge. Presently, I am actively engaged
                in courses on Udemy, covering a wide range of topics, including Node.js, MongoDB,
                Express.js, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and Flutter. Additionally, I leverage SoloLearn
                to reinforce my understanding of programming languages. While I may consider myself
                proficient, revisiting the basics is always beneficial. Below, {"you'll"} find
                certificates {"I've"} earned through SoloLearn.
