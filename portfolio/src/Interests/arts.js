            <section>
                <p>
                    While I deeply appreciate the world of arts, I must admit that my own artistic
                    talents are somewhat limited. During my high school years, I {"didn't"} actively
                    participate in arts and culture activities, with the exception of a memorable
                    role in our grade 8 concert where I delivered two lines. This should give you a
                    sense of my artistic prowess.

                    However, my university years provided me with a couple of opportunities to dip
                    my toes into the realm of art and expression:

                <h3>Canvas</h3>
                <p>
                    This annual university event assigns a common theme to each hostel, challenging
                    them to translate it into art. Hostels collaborate to design their artwork,
                    which is then painted in a single, overnight sessionâ€”a truly unique and
                    immersive experience. Although my artistic skills were limited, I had the
                    privilege of contributing to the painting process.

                <h3>Serenade</h3>
                <p>
                    Despite my limited vocal talents, I had the honor of joining the De Wilgers
                    serenade team in 2022. This is an annual acapella competition held at NWU,
                    involving year-round training and culminating in a second-semester competition.
                    It stands as one of {"NWU's"} major cultural events, and while I hold it dear to
                    my heart, I must admit that I prefer watching the performances rather than
                    actively participating. Due to unforeseen circumstances, our team was not able
                    to take part in the final event, but it is still a challenge I {"don't"} regret
                    taking.
